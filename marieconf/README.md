My takkun config. It doesn't upload images to Imgur or have Twilio up. It's good enough like this for me.

It saves the webcam shot of the intruder to the home directory under takkun.jpg.

It uses the alarm function, however, for it to function as mentioned before, the .wav files have to be in ~/takkun.

I also use a ~/.takkun_passwd file.
